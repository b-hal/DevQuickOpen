# DevQuickOpen

## Introduction
Quick Open is a development tool with the major goal of quickly opening forms, methods, classes, etc. in 4D and is inspired by Xcode's Quickly Open or macOS' Spotlight features. Beyond that, it also handles the creation and opening of documentation and a few smaller things.

## Features
The Quick Open window has the following features:
- Use a shortcut (Option-Space) to open the window
- Start typing any part of the name of a form, class, method, database method, trigger, or DevDoc
- A list of entries will appear, sorted by relevance
- You can keep typing or use the up/down arrow keys to select an item to open it.
- Hitting enter/return will open the item.
- Hitting Option-Enter/Return will open the item's markdown documentation, creating it if necessary.
- Hitting Esc clears the search. Hitting it again closes the window.
- You can right-click on an item for additional options.
- The list will show a paperclip for items that have documentation.
- The list shows the folder path to items. One thing this is useful for is finding what folder an item is in if misplaced.
